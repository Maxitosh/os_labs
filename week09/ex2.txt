Let's take for example 5 frames of real memory

INCREASING
Given sequence of references such 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 and so on
Gives us 5 misses at first and each tick of time increase hits by 5
For given example now ratio is 15/5=3 and it is increasing providing sequence using such cyclic pattern

DECREASING
To get such situation we have to have some hits, otherwise ration=hit/miss will be 0
That's why we cannot use sequence like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and so on.
To make decreasing sequence let's use previous example and add one or two more different pages
Like 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 and ratio is 3/18=0.167
Each round it decreases, because number of pages is bigger than number of available framess
